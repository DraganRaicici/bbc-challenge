Ideas:

- do soemthing about the date, don't get it from the content header map, but from con.getDate() and convert it to date.
- Custom exception handler to handle all exceptions and refractor the ones existing neatly.
- add tests for jsonconverter
- convert task to a interface for easier testing?
